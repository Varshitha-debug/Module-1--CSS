      <h2>Community Bulletin</h2>
      <p>
  Our neighborhood is buzzing with activities and events that bring people together and strengthen our bonds. From weekly farmer's markets to weekend storytelling sessions for kids, there’s something for everyone. Community spirit is what keeps us vibrant, and participation is key!
  <br><br>
  In addition to these events, we are proud to announce the launch of our sustainability drive. Residents are encouraged to reduce plastic usage, segregate waste, and support local businesses. Small changes lead to big impacts—let’s build a greener tomorrow, together.
  <br><br>
  The community library has also reopened with extended hours and a refreshed collection. Don’t miss the monthly book club meetings held on the last Sunday of every month. Interested members can sign up via the community app or directly at the front desk.
  <br><br>
  Meanwhile, safety remains a priority. Night patrols have been increased and new CCTV installations are underway at key junctions. Your feedback on security and suggestions for improvement are always welcome.
  <br><br>
  Lastly, a huge shout-out to the volunteers behind the success of the recent Blood Donation Camp. Over 150 units were collected in just one day! Initiatives like these truly showcase the power of community.
